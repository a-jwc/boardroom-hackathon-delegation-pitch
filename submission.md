Hi everyone,

I am a senior computer science undergraduate, web 3.0 technical education intern, and open source enthusiast. I was researching OpenLaw for a presentation when I discovered Boardroom and the Decentralized Governance Hackathon occurring. I understood this as a great opportunity to work with these products.

Here is my submission for the "Add A Delegate Pitch To Your Voter Profile" challenge.
